# Topology and Applied Topology Self-Study
These are the notes taken while studying the textbooks recommended by the MIT OCW Applied Topology class:
1. Basic Topology by Armstrong
2. Applied Topology by Alan Hatcher.
In addition, I will need to learn some basics of Abstract Algebra, for which I plan to study:
3. Gentle Introduction to Abstract Algebra by B. A. Sethuraman.
This endeavour is necessitated by the terrible course content of the Applied Topology class I took with JHU. The class whetted my appetite for learning TDA, but did not build any of the theoretical foundation or the skills needed to apply the method.
